Your team (name of each individual participating): Giovanna Stern
How many JUnits were you able to get to pass? Three of my tests passed. I completed writing methods for 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and partially 5.
Please note: None of my tests related to customers pass because I could not determine how to read in the dependent array. Instead, I adjusted some customer fields to constants for purposes of working on the program. 
I also was not able to complete any methods dealing with maps because I ran out of time to learn what they are.

Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.

Feedback for the coding competition?  Things you would like to see in future events?
Although I didn't get all tests to pass, I thought this was a great experience. I enjoyed that the problem was centered around a real-world scenario so that is something I would continue to do.
I am currently a Freshman/Sophomore level in my studies so it gave me better insight on how I would apply what I am currently learning. 
I would also highly recommend future competitors to work in a team.
